#Randomized (optimized) imputation
#Aesthetic Chill = item 43 NEO-FFI Twin dataset arrange (Wide twin 1 and 2 in two column)
# After exclusion of twin pairs that did not report scores for any of the 3 surveys
# 1) we prioritized complete answers from twin pairs. For example, twin pairs were selected when both twins reported scores for the Item 43 on one of the surveys. 
#    If both twins answered in more than one survey, we randomly selected data for the pair from one of the complete surveys; 
#    + split 1
#    + split 2
#    + split 3
# 2) if one of the two twinâ€™s response was missing for all of the three surveys, we randomly selected a survey with the response for the other twin
#    + split 1
#    + split 2
#    + split 3
